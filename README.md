# ThumbHash

This library is a .NET implementation of [ThumbHash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash).

## What is a thumbhash?

A very compact representation of a placeholder for an image. Store it inline with your data and show it while the real image is loading for a smoother loading experience.

[See a demo of ThumbHash in action _here_](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/).
